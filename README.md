==========

An experimental dice bot for Discord.

Features
--------

**Multiple Rolls**: [make multiple rolls on a single line](#multiple-rolls), separated by a comma

**Math**: [add, subtract, multiply and divide dice results and modifiers](#using-math-operators)

**Tag Your Rolls**: [label your rolls with tags](#tagging-rolls), so the results will be marked

**Keeping & Discarding Rolls**: [roll multiple dice and keep the lowest or highest](#special-rules)

**Exploding Dice**: with optional target numbers for [explosions](#special-rules)

**Wild Dice**: supports Savage Worlds-style wild dice natively

**Dice Pools**: Clattr supports game systems that use dice pools with target numbers

**Fate Dice**: You can use fate dice too

**Cleans Up its Mess**: Clattr removes your roll message and tags you with the result - clattr, but no cluttr!

**Nicely Formatted**: Clattr puts its results first, roll details later for easy reading 

**Better Randomness**: Clattr will give more 'random-feeling' results than some dice rollers, no streaks or runs (it uses the mersenne-twister PRNG algorithm, if you're curious)

**Playing Cards**: fully simulated playing card decks, for use in Savage Worlds initiative, your Deck of Many Things, or any other card-based game mechanic

**Almost Everything Else**: but if you can't use it with your favorite game, or it's kinda clunky, [let me know](https://github.com/nphyx/clattr-bot/issues)

Bot Commands
------------

Every die roll starts with `:r` followed by a space - that tells the bot to pay attention and read the rest of the line. It will ignore any other messages. You can use the `:r` command in any channel where Clattr is active. When it finishes calculating your roll it will @you with the result and delete your original message, keeping things tidy.

You can also use Clattr via DM if you need to roll privately; just open a DM channel with it. It is not allowed to delete your original command in DM.

Card commands start with `:c` followed by a space, the command, and optionally a deck name if you need to have multiple decks in play. Clattr doesn't just generate a random playing card - it uses a fully simulated deck, with a stock, discard pile, and a strongly randomized shuffling algorithm (Fisher-Yates). Decks start out shuffled, can be re-shuffled manually, and automatically reshuffle when the stock is depleted. Decks include 2 jokers - if your game doesn't need jokers, just ignore them for now.

Each guild (discord server) shares its decks, so if you have multiple games running in the same guild it would be wise to label your decks by game. Direct messages with the Clattr-bot have their own private decks.

Note the card system is still under development, and does not yet support hands, op/dealer privileges, or anything like that. It's good for simple tasks but won't work for most playing card games.

Examples by Game System
-----------------------

### D&D (3rd-5th edition), D20 System, Pathfinder

Use `d` type (polyhedral) dice.

| Example                                     | description |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `:r d20+7 #persuasion`                      | roll a persuasion check |
| `:r 8d6 #fireball`                          | roll damage for a fireball |
| `:r 2d20k1+7 #hit, 1d4+3d6+4 #sneak attack` | roll to hit with advantage + sneak attack damage |
| `:r d4+1 #1, 1d4+1 #2, 1d4+1 #3`            | roll magic missile with individual targets | 
| `:r 2d20l1-1 #con save`                     | roll a constitution save with disadvantage | 
| `:r d20+7+d4 #blessed :)`                   | roll under the effects of bless | 
| `:r d20+7-d4 #bane :(`                      | roll under the effects of bane | 
| `:r d20!l1 #hit`                            | roll 1d20 with critical hit support (keeping the second result on a 20), for 2nd/3rd Edition & Pathfinder |
| `:r d20!18l1 #hit`                          | roll 1d20 that crits on 18-20, clever girl |

### Storyteller

Use `p` type (pool) dice. Pool dice default to d10s, so when playing storyteller you don't need to specify the die size.

| Example                                     | description |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `:r 5p`                                     | roll a pool of 10-sided dice with a target of 8-10  |
| `:r 5pt7`                                    | roll a pool of 10-sided dice with a target of 7-10, if you're special  |

### Shadowrun

You'll have to specify p6 for your shadowrun dice, but you can make them explode!

| Example                                     | description |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `:r 3p6! #firearms`                         | roll a pool of three 6-sided exploding dice  |

### Fate

Fate dice (type `f`) default to a pool of 4, so you can omit the dice count usually. Clattr will display them as `+`, `-`, and ` ` in the results.

| Example                                     | description |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `:r f+3 #athletics`                         | do an athletics check  |
| `:r 6f+3 #extra dice`                       | if you need to roll more than 4 fate dice, you can do that  |

### Savage Worlds

Use `w` type (wild) dice for Trait tests. Note that `w` applies exploding rules automatically, but for exploding
damage and other non-Trait rolls you need to use the '!' (exploding) modifier.

| Example                                     | description |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `:r w8+2 #survival`                         | A ranger adding his Woodsman survival bonus |
| `:r w10w8 #shooting, 3d6!+4 #damage`        | An Interface Zero agent with a smart weapon system, using his custom Wild Die size |


Roll Syntax
-----------

When rolling, you can polyhedral dice (`d`), dice pools (`p`), wild dice (`w`) or fate dice (`f`). You can also use plain numbers (for modifiers and other math).

The format for dice `<number of dice><die type><die size><special modifiers>`. so:

| roll      | result                                           |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `:r 1d20` | `@you rolled 12  :::  (1d20 [12] = 12)`          |
| `:r 4p10` | `@you rolled 2  :::  (4p10 [1,10,6,8] = 2)`      |
| `:r 4f`   | `@you rolled 1  :::  (4f [[+],[+],[ ],[-]] = 1)` |
| `:r 10`   | `@you rolled 10  :::  (10)`                      |


### Target Numbers

Dice pools support target numbers:

| roll        | result                                           |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `:r 5p10t7` | `@you rolled 3  :::  (5p10t7 [10,2,7,4,9] = 3)`  |

### Using math operators

Adding (`+`), subtracting (`+`), multiplying (`*`) and dividing (`/`) are easy:

| roll        | result                                           |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `:r 1d20+7` | `@you rolled 22  :::  (1d20 [15] + 7 = 22)`      |
| `:r 1d20-2` | `@you rolled 3  :::  (1d20 [5] - 2 = 3)`         |
| `:r 1d20*2` | `@you rolled 22  :::  (1d20 [11] * 2 = 22)`      |
| `:r 1d20/2` | `@you rolled 9.5  :::  (1d20 [19] / 2 = 9.5)`    |

You can also use math on dice rolls:

| roll          | result                                                 |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `:r 1d6+1d4`  | `@you rolled 4  :::  (1d6 [3] + 1d4 [1] = 4)`          |
| `:r 3p10+4p6` | `@you rolled 3  :::  (3p10 [3,5,8] + 4p6 [3,6,6] = 3)` |

Math operations are simple left-to-right order, so if you do `3+4*2+3` you'll get `3+4=7 -> 7*2=14 -> 14+3=17`

### Special Rules

You can use keep-the-highest (`k`), keep-the-lowest (`l`), and explode (`!`) dice.

| roll          | result                                      |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `:r 2d20k1`   | `@you rolled 16  :::  (2d20k1 [3,16] = 16)` |
| `:r 2d20l1`   | `@you rolled 5  :::  (2d20l1 [5,19] = 5)`   |
| `:r 1d20!`    | `@you rolled 23  :::  (1d20! [20,3] = 23)`  |

You can set a target and maximum for exploding dice:

| roll            | result                                          |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `:r 1d20!19`    | `@you rolled 43 ::: (1d20!19 [20,19,4] = 43)`   |
| `:r 1d20!19m1`  | `@you rolled 39  :::  (1d20!19m1 [20,19] = 39)` |

The maximum number of explosions for a single die is 5. This is to stop clever and crazy people from crashing the bot with infinite `1d1` explosions, sorry :)

For keeping the lowest / highest dice, you can keep more than one:

| roll         | result                                          |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `:r 3d20k2`  | `@you rolled 22  :::  (3p20k2 [5,10,12] = 22)`  |
| `:r 3p20l2`  | `@you rolled 14  :::  (3p20l2 [8,6,12] = 14)`   |


### Combining Rules

Special rules can be combined, and are executed in order.

| roll         | result                                          |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `:r 1d20!l1` | `@you rolled 8  :::  (1d20!l1 [20,8] = 8)`      |

### Custom Wild Die sizes

Some Savage Worlds settings provide edges or gear that increases your wild die size. You can add a second `w#` to a wild roll to modify your wild die.

| roll         | result                                          |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `:r w10w6`   | `@you rolled 22  :::  (w10w6 [5,6,3] = 9)`      |
| `:r w4w8`    | `@you rolled 14  :::  (w6w6 [4,3,6] = 7)`       |

### Multiple Rolls

You can make separate rolls in a single command and display the results individually.

| roll               | result                                                           |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `:r 1d20+7, 1d6+1` | `@you rolled 12, 4  :::  (1d20 [5] + 7 = 12), (1d6 [3] + 1 = 4)` |

### Tagging Rolls

Add a tag to label your rolls using `#`

| roll                | result                                              |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `:r 1d20+7 #to hit` | `@you rolled to hit: 17  :::  (1d20 [10] + 7 = 17)` |

You can tag each roll in a multi-roll command:

| roll                               | result                                                                            |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `:r 1d20+7 #to hit, 1d6+1 #damage` | `@you rolled to hit: 17, damage: 4  :::  (1d20 [10] + 7 = 17), (1d6 [3] + 1 = 4)` |

### Full Breakdown

Setup
-----

Clattr is currently in testing and you probably shouldn't even be reading this. You can't install the "official" version because it's not hosted online. You'll have
to run it on your own computer for now, or know someone who does. Will set up a server after completing the rest of its needed features.

1) download the source code: `git clone https://github.com/nphyx/clattr-bot`
2) change to the clattr-bot directory: `cd clattr-bot`
3) install packages: `npm install .`
4) follow standard Discord bot setup procedure [https://discordjs.guide/#/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application]
5) get your bot token (use the guide above, and note that Clattr requires the 'manage messages' permission)
6) copy .env.example to .env and fill out the environment variables
7) run the bot, in Linux: `npm start`
8) start playing!

Roadmap
-------

- *coin tosses*: you can simulate coin tosses with 1d2, but there's some code supporting coins specifically that just needs user interface and formatting
- *advanced playing card rules*: support for dealers, player hands, managed discard piles, and multi-pack decks is planned but unimplemented
- *other cards*: a lot of the playing cards code is reusable, but need to create lists of face cards, suits, etc. for other card systems (Tarot, etc)
- *help command*: display help & examples in game (later)
- *saving rolls for reuse (macros)*: planned, but needs lots of work
